        <b>About: </b>Cillian Murphy (born 25 May 1976) is an Irish actor. He
        made his professional debut in Enda Walsh's 1996 play Disco Pigs, a role
        he later reprised in the 2001 screen adaptation. His early film credits
        include the horror film 28 Days Later (2002), the dark comedy
        Intermission (2003), the thriller Red Eye (2005), the Irish war drama
        The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006), and the science fiction thriller
        Sunshine (2007). He played a transgender Irish woman in the comedy-drama
        Breakfast on Pluto (2005), which earned him a Golden Globe Award
        nomination. Murphy began his collaboration with filmmaker Christopher
        Nolan in 2005, playing the Scarecrow in The Dark Knight trilogy
        (2005–2012) as well as appearing in Inception (2010) and Dunkirk (2017).
        He gained greater prominence for his role as Tommy Shelby in the BBC
        period drama series Peaky Blinders (2013–2022) and for starring in the
        horror sequel A Quiet Place Part II (2020). Murphy portrayed J. Robert
        Oppenheimer in Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023), for which he received the
        Academy Award for Best Actor, along with a BAFTA Award and a Golden
        Globe Award. In 2011, Murphy won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding
        Solo Performance for the one-man play Misterman. In 2020, The Irish
        Times named him one of the greatest Irish film actors of all time.
